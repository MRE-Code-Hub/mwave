% In this run, we will create a 'HydroBody' in Wamit. The HydroBody will be
% a cylinder in heave. For more details on creating a HydroBody, see 
% example Wamit_createHB_1.

% The HydroBody created here is used in example hydroBody_2

%% Set up run

folder = [mwavePath '\Examples\BemRuns\' run_name];  

rho = 1025;     % water density
h = 8;          % water depth
T = 1:0.5:8;    % wave periods (8 s wave is 64 m long at 8 m depth, if 
                % this were scaled to full scale by mulitplying by 5 (40 m
                % water depth), the wave would be 320 m long, and have a
                % period of 17 s)

% set up cylinder dimension
rad = 1;
draft = 1;
hei = 2;

Ntheta = 24;

wec = FloatingCylinder(rho, rad, hei, draft, Ntheta, Nr, Nz);

% In Wamit_createHB_1, the cylindrical array of points was created
% manually. However, in WamitRunCondition, one may also use BemCylArray, 
% which automatically creates the points with a cos spacing in z. For
% NemohRunCondition, only BemCylArray is valid (i.e. it doesn't take a list
% of points) - see Nemoh_createHB_1
