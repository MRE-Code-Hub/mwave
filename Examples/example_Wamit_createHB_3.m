% In this run, we will create a 'HydroBody' in Wamit. A HydroBody is a
% special class that is required for the array interaction theory. It is
% basically a FloatingBody with hydrodynamic parameters attached, including
% added mass, damping, hydrostatics, and the so-called "force transfer
% matrix" which is described in the 2014 Ocean Engineering paper. In
% addition to these it has wave field coefficient - Radiation coefficients
% and the diffraction transfer matrix. HydroBodies depend on wave period
% and water depth (and geometry), but not incident wave direction
%
% It is created by computing the wavefield on a circular cylinder of points
% circumscribing a geometry, and then running waves at the geometry from
% all directions surrounding the body. At this point, symmetry of the body
% is not exploited, but it should be. This is a big TODO
%
% For more info on the theory see the 2013 IJOME paper and the 2014 Ocean
% Engineering paper.

                                % more points near the free-surface because
                                % progressive waves decay exponentially

hydBody = computeHydroBody(waveCir, hydroForces, wec, 'SigFigCutoff', 5,...

% 'SigFigCutoff', N tells the computation to only use the first N 
% significant figures. 'AccTrim' removes values on the ends that do not
% contribute significantly to reproducing the wave field. Without these
% options, when you compute arrays, you may get a warning message:
%
% Warning: Matrix is close to singular or badly scaled. Results may be 
% inaccurate. RCOND =  6.653070e-65. 
%
% This is because the diffraction transfer matrix has some small values,
% which are likely meaningless, and which makes the matrix solution hard to
% find. To get rid of these values, when you create the HydroBody, use, the
% options 'SigFigCutoff', 5, and 'AccTrim'. See example, Wamit_createHB_1


% Here, we're saving it in the working folder that we've been using and
% saving it by a name that will help us recognize it. It does take a while
% to do these runs in Wamit, so you really only want to create a HydroBody
% once and then save it 
save([mwavePath 'Examples\HydroBodies\wam_hb1_1_hb'], 'hydBody');

% And that's it for this example, in other examples we'll use the HydroBody
% to see its power!!
%   - hydroBody_1: use a single HydroBody to compute power and WaveFields
%   - array_inter_1: use the HydroBody to compute array interactions
